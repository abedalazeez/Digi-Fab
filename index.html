            <h2 class="sch">Why DigiFab</h2>
            <p class="scp">My name is Abed-alazeez al sayed, and I am a first-year student in Computer Engineering at Østfold University College. 
                I came to Norway at the end of 2015 and have lived in Halden since mid-2016. I studied a bit about networking in Syria in addition to my studies at the
                 Faculty of Economics at Aleppo University. I had been curious since my childhood to discover how things work My interest in digital production started 
                 when I started working in the IT department of an ice cream factory. Where the maintenance department in the factory developed or imitated some
                  technologies due to their high price or lack thereof in Syria, and from there I felt the importance of a small innovation that saves a lot of work. 
                  With the beginning of the proliferation of Internet of Things and smart home technology, the topic became very interesting to me. I hope through this 
                  topic that I learn skills in digital production, and I also feel that such material can expand my ideas and open before my eyes wonderful ideas that are 
                  interesting and useful.</p>

            <p class="scp">The first impression of product coming from design, and give extra function to the product. 
                In prototyping design its okay to use a simple design that is more functional, but the first design should give a nice impression. 
                In my case i use adobe illustrator in 2D design and Autodesk Fusion 360 for 3D design.

            <h2 class="sch">Electronics and Arduino</h2>
            <p class="scp">The Arduino is an electronic development board consisting of an open source electronic circuit with a computer-programmed microcontroller,
                 designed to facilitate the use of interactive electronics in multidisciplinary projects. The Arduino is mainly used in the design of interactive 
                 electronic projects or projects that aim to build different environmental sensors such as temperature, wind, light, pressure, etc... The Arduino can
                  be connected to various programs on the personal computer, and its programming depends on the open source programming language Processing, and the 
                  programming codes are characterized The Arduino language is similar to the C language and is one of the easiest programming languages ​​used to write
                   microcontroller programs.<br> For more information click on the slide picture.</p>

            <h2 class="sch">Raspberry Pi</h2>
            <p class="scp">The Raspberry Pi is a single card computer built on a single circuit board the size of a bank card. It was developed by the British company
                 Raspberry Pi Foundation with the aim of encouraging the teaching of electronics programming in schools.
                Raspberry Pi 3. It is fully compatible with older versions, but needs a new Raspbian kernel. It has been expanded with a new chip for WLAN and Bluetooth.
                 The processor has switched from ARMv7 to ARMv8 which features 64-bit architecture, but the new core only supports 32-bit.

        <p class="scp">3D printing is a technology that depends on the production of forms of a high degree of complexity with the least possible materials
             used in manufacturing by traditional methods, that is, it is the process of manufacturing new materials based on digital files by means of computer
              programs, and it is referred to as the process of creating a printed form by adding a layer One by one, from the materials to eventually come out into
               a three-dimensional material, which appears in the form of slices or horizontal segments
