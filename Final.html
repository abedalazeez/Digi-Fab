            <h3>Design and idea</h3>
            <p>The basic idea of ​​the project is to create a reminder to those present in a laboratory or workshop of the necessity of using a hearing aid. 
                The box shows the shape of a headset, the color of which varies according to the level of noise, the green color appears in the case of calm 
                or very low sounds, while the yellow color appears in the medium volume levels, while the high sounds show the red color.</p>
            <figure>
                <img class="img" src="imges/box.jpeg"></figure> 
            <h3>Box Design</h3>
            <p>The design of the box was made using laser cutting technology, using wood with a thickness of 3 mm for the base and all sides. The facade was made using
                 a transparent acrylic sheet of 3mm thickness, was cut to facilitate the entry of sound in the form of the high school logo to add some nice design. 
                 The headphone place was graved to show the light from the LED as one spot of light not several different spots and a sticker was added that to both side of acrylic,
                  was cut from black vinyl so that not showing the component  inside the box</p>

            <h3>3d Printing</h3>
            <p>
                As we explained in the 3D printing section, it was printed using PLA. For more details,<a href="3D.html">see the 3D printing page.</a>  
                To focus the light better, a sheet of foil was pasted. </p>

            <h3>Electronics and Programming</h3>
                         
           <p>In the electronics part, ESP32 was used for several reasons, one important reason is the low consumption of energy. It is possible to run the project using a power bank,
                and the most important reason is the possibility of development, where the project can be linked to a server and collect noise level information through a central server 
                using Wi-Fi. For more information about the electronic section and programming <a href="ESP32.html">see ESP32 page</a>A blue LED was added behind the high school logo cut out to match the color of the blue logo</p>
